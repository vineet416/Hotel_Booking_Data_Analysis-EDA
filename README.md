# Hotel Booking Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the booking cancellations of two hotels: **City Hotel** and **Resort Hotel**. The goal of this analysis is to identify the factors contributing to high cancellation rates and provide actionable insights to help the hotels reduce cancellations, optimize room usage, and increase revenue.

**Key focus areas of the analysis:**
- Identifying variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations.
- Understanding the factors that contribute to cancellation patterns.
- Providing business insights to assist in pricing and promotional decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains bookings made between 2015 and 2017, with key information such as:
- Booking status (canceled/not canceled).
- Reservation dates.
- Average Daily Rate (ADR).
- Market segment of the guests (online travel agencies, direct, groups).
- Hotel type (City Hotel/Resort Hotel).
- Guest information (country, arrival date, etc.).

## Data Cleaning Process

Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis:
1. **Data Importing & Merging:** Combining datasets to get a complete view.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Removing or imputing missing values.
3. **Duplicate Removal:** Identifying and deleting duplicate records.
4. **Unwanted Columns:** Dropping columns that are irrelevant for analysis.
5. **Outlier Detection:** Identifying and removing outliers that may skew results.

## Research Questions
1. **What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?**
2. **How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations?**
3. **How can this analysis help hotels with pricing and promotional strategies?**

## Hypothesis
1. Higher prices lead to more cancellations.
2. Longer waiting lists lead to higher cancellation rates.
3. The majority of clients come from offline travel agents, contributing to cancellations.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Microsoft Word:** For presenting the analysis.

## Analysis and Findings

- **Reservation Status:** Approximately 37% of all reservations were canceled, significantly impacting hotel revenue.
  
- **Reservation Status by Hotel Type:** City Hotels see more bookings, but Resort Hotels may have higher prices contributing to higher cancellations.

- **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** There is a pattern where cancellations are more frequent on days with higher ADRs, especially for Resort Hotels on weekends and holidays.

- **Monthly Reservation Trends:** August has the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations, while January sees the most cancellations.

- **Top Countries with Cancellations:** Portugal ranks highest in terms of reservation cancellations.

- **Booking Source:** Around 46% of bookings come from online travel agencies, followed by 27% from groups, and only 4% directly from hotels.

- **ADR by Cancellation Status:** Higher ADRs tend to result in higher cancellation rates.

## Suggestions

1. **Pricing Strategy:** Lower the prices on specific days or provide discounts to reduce cancellations.
   
2. **Resort Hotel Discounts:** Offer discounts during weekends or holidays, as Resort Hotels experience higher cancellations during these periods.

3. **Marketing Campaigns in January:** Launch targeted campaigns in January to boost revenue and reduce the high cancellation rate in this month.

4. **Improve Services in Portugal:** Enhancing hotel services, particularly in Portugal, may reduce cancellations from that region.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights key areas for improvement in hotel booking management, including pricing adjustments, enhanced marketing strategies, and improved service quality. Implementing these recommendations could significantly reduce cancellations and help City and Resort Hotels optimize room usage and increase revenue.

## How This Project Relates to the Data Analyst Role

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply data cleaning techniques, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract actionable business insights. By analyzing trends, I have provided practical recommendations that can help businesses improve operational efficiency and increase revenueâ€”skills that are highly transferable to a data analyst role at any company, including Zomato.
